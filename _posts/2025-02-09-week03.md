This week's blog post aims to reflect on the extention activities that me and my groupmates have been working on oevr the past few days.

My group has overcame a numbers of challenges over the course of the past week and I am really proud of the process. We initially thought of making an extension that offers the contact information of the GitHub user, just like those offering personal email address for LinkedIn users. However, with further research and work, I, along with my group mates, figured that it’s technically very challenging to acquire the verification from the GitHub management team. Therefore, we started brainstorming other ideas, including a currency exchange extension, a to-do list, but eventually landed with the proposal of making a notepad for the common GitHub commands. We thought of it because we are all new to some of the functional features of GitHub and we believe many new contributors might face the same situation. Therefore, with such extension, it’s easier for people to look for immediate tips when making contributions. I am in charge of writing the read-me file and building the fundamental structure of the code.
