I have so far made two contributions: one on open street map and one on wikipedia.

The most challenging part is trying to verify the legitimacy of the exisiting information and to ensure my conribution aligns with the truth. I am most proud of the open map contributions because I update the latest landscape of my local communities with the information I notice. This really reminds me of the true meaning of open source contributions, where we each contribute our ideas and observations to the collection of those from people within the community and make the project better.
