1. Open source means open for future editing and collaborations so that each engineer could contribute their own portion of work for the community to learn and work upon.

2. Open course is better for collaoration and has better potential for advancement as each indivdiual could contribute their own thoughts and creativity, while it might be hard to standardized the requirement for all contributors and certain security risks might threat the protection of the original idea.

3. I registered this class because I would like to have more hands-on experinece with open source development.

4. a) VS code - an editor that I like to use for coding and its prioritization on editing upon exisiting code has been very helpful.
    b) wikipedia- a great encyclepedia site where everyone can contribute their authentic knowlege of a certian topic.
    c) React - make collaboration on coding project so much easier.
    d) Linux - the linux system serves as the core server for almost all cloud servers and its open source kernal operating system allows the advancement of the platform.
