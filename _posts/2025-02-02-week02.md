Part 1

GoProject's code of conduct offers a clear instruction on seeking for help, communicating with the members, and creating a sense of community. Specifically, with the contact emails listed, all new contributors could know where to seek for help when needed, which improves communication efficiency within the group and makes the exchange of ideas more smooth. Such guideline is important when building an order within an open source group project.

Two major differences between the code of conduct of the go project and the contributor convenant is that the go project would not guarantee a reply to every complaint while the convenant ensures all messages will be replied after a complete investigation and the length of two documents.

I think the go project offers such changes due to the fact that it's a growing project and people enjoy equal share to the resources. Therefore, there's no such individual who's in charge of a certain responsibility, like providing feedback, which makes the difference justifiable.

Eclipse code of conduct: https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php

One major difference is that the go project requests all individuals to behave nicely at all time as they think that the individual's reputation could influence that of the project's, while Eclipse only emphasizes on that within the domain of the project. I think that the reason to the difference is due to that eclipse update its code of conduct holistically every once in a while while go project's has been there for quite sime time. Different demands and goals might also contribute to the difference.

Part 2

Sugar lab's code of conduct is based on the ubuntu's while go project's is adapeted from the contributor covenant's.

Part 3

Code of conduct
https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/

Although they both emphasizes on the importance of respect when making contirbutions, Django Project's code of conduct emphasizes the importance to understand the reason of conflicts and resolve them in a constuructive mannger, while the other twos didn't propose such approach.
