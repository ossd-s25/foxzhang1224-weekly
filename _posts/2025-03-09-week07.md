title: Week 7

I think me and my group and completed a very decent amount of work this week and we've overcame a lot of challenges.

<!--more-->

We've found a variety of projects from both the repository and on our own, including those of social goods, education, and general website, like open food facts, free code camp, and sharktrack. However, with careful evaluation, we eliminated most of those options due to lack of activities, meaningful contribution ideas, and clear instruction guideline. With the help of the professor and groupmates, we eventually picked the project Oppia after careful evaluation of its project landscape, where we would try and resolve the proposed issue and add meaningful contribution to expand on its existing resouces. 

The languages used in the Oppia project are very practical and publicly used, including HTML, CSS, and Python. All teamates have previous experience of engaging with these languages in class, but barely with feasible projects, which makes this opportunity a wonderful exeprience to practice the skills in a real life setting.

The group has decided to meet up weekly to discuss the matter with contributions and allocation of work and I look forward to work with my buddies for further contributions.
