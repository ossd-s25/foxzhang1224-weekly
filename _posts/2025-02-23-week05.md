1. what are your thoughts about different projects that you have looked at so far? 

All projects I've looked so far are coded in different languages, with different goals. My favourite one is the Musescore, because it seems very accessible, and the members are active in making contriutions.

2. what are you most excited about regarding working on an opens source project? 

There are two things that make me most excited about working on an open source project: creativity and collaboration. I think starting a project from scratch can sometimes be very challenging. However, if there's an existing project available, a clear direction could be offered with additional space allowed for creativity. In addition, collaborating with other professionals on building toward the same goal offers the opportunity to further advance my coding skill.

3. what do you think will be the biggest challenges? how do you plan to overcome them?

Since the group members are unlikely to meet in person, each contributions will most likley be fully independent. Therefore, it might be hard to communicate when technical difficulties kick in. However, with multiple communication channels being offered, taking full opportunities to reach out to other members and seek for feedback will be very vital in ensuring a smooth collaboration experience.
