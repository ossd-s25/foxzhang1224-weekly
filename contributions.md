|  March 16th   |  https://www.openstreetmap.org/note/4667766#map=15/40.72939/-73.98177&layers=N   |  Add notes on open street map    | The cafe downstairs of my building occupies two separated space, one for the cafe and one for the restaurant. It was not shown on the map because these two spaces share the same address, but I added a description to the map so people will not be misguided if the look up cafe but ended up being at the restaurant.     |
|  March 17th   | https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Converse_(brand)&diff=prev&oldid=1280997085    |  Add notes on Conevrse's wikipedia page   |  I suggested the key role of converse shoes played in Japanese street culture in th 1980s.    |
|  April 6th  | (https://www.oppia.org/contributor-dashboard#)  |  Translates lessions subtitles on Oppia  |  I translated the subtitles and course content from English to Mandarin Chinese.    |
|  April 13th  | https://www.openstreetmap.org/note/4710362#map=15/51.50976/-0.13049&layers=N|  Adding missing location for the stage bar on open street map |  I added a unbdocumanted bar restaurant called the stage bar located within the lononder hotel I stayed in London. | I realized that when I was trying to search up for the bar it's not shown, but only with teh explicit address since they automatically believe it's within the hotel. With the notes, people who are ignorant to the knowledge that it's part of the hotel will have access to the location.  |
|  April 20th  | https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/4140 |  Fixing front end css error in sourcecode |  I proposed the solution of deleting all <span> tag in the sourcecode to reduce the redundancy. | After inspecting all the frontend code, including javascript and html for the repository, I realized that the inclusion of the tag <span> could contribute to additional signal to two method, causing the error with postMessage() taking 2 instances of the object worker. By removing that, we can clear out the useless part and then see if it can logically cut off the duplicate operation of the call of the method. |
